# **Vivliothiki** Books Recommender
## Why BooksRecommeder ❓ 🤷‍♀

In our department's library the problem is that students do not know what books are available in the library, nor the best books they need, so it's became difficult to choose the right book.
So the objectif is to provide a recommender system to our university's students and make the process more convivial.

## Requirements 📃

* First of all the users will have to authenticate to his account to access the application. 🏤
* Consulting the recommended books. 📚
* Consulting the list of books in the library with the image, title and rating of each book. 📕 ⭐️
* Search for a book by title or keyword. 🔎
* Evaluate a book in case the book has already been read by the student.❤️ 
* Modify their profile information (password, year...). 🔧

## Technology Used

In this project we used the *Hybride Recommendations* between : *Item based* & *users based* collaborative systems
